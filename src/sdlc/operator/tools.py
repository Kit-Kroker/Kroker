"""The operator's twelve verbs (E-86).

Plain async functions taking OperatorDeps first. No pydantic_ai, no fastapi:
agent.py adapts these for the chat surface and E-11's MCP server will adapt
the same functions, so anything framework-shaped belongs in the adapter and
not here. tests/test_operator_layering.py enforces it.

Reads return rendered ASCII text (render.py). read_artifact, follow, and the
three writes return typed models, because their fields -- truncated,
next_offset, timed_out, confirmed -- carry meaning the model must branch on
rather than read prose about.
